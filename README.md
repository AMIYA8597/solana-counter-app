# Solana Counter App

A simple counter application built on the Solana blockchain using **Anchor (Rust)** for the smart contract and **React** for the frontend.

## Overview
This project demonstrates a decentralized counter application:
- Users can increment and decrement a counter.
- The counter's state is stored and managed on the Solana blockchain (Devnet).

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 
- [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/) (or any Solana-compatible wallet)

---

## Deployment and Usage

### Smart Contract Deployment
1. Open [Solana Playground](https://solanaplayground.io/).
2. Upload your smart contract code (Anchor program) in the browser IDE.
3. Deploy the contract to **Solana Devnet** using the **Deploy** button in Solana Playground.
4. Note down the program ID after deployment.

### Frontend Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-counter-app.git
   cd solana-counter-app
   ```
2. Navigate to the `app` directory:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```
3. Update the program ID in the frontend to match the deployed program (in your `.env` file or config file, depending on your setup).
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
6. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
